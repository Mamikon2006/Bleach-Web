					Chad is a tall teenager of Japanese and Mexican descent, and appears to be older than he really is. He has a tattoo on his left shoulder that consists of a winged heart and a snake, with a ribbon that reads 'Amore e Morte' ("love and death" in Italian) and has a very big mouth. During his early years, Chad was extremely violent. Exploiting his advantage in size, he intimidated and hit any child who annoyed him. Oscar Joaquin de la Rosa, his grandfather, 'Abuelo' inspired Chad to be gentle. Afterwards, Oscar gave Chad an old Mexican coin, which he treasured after Oscar's death.[5] Since then, Chad vowed that he would never fight unless it was to protect others, as instructed — even if his own life was in danger.[6] However, because of his constant involvement with gangsters, Chad gained a reputation as a ruthless gangster himself.[5]

                    Chad is a quiet person with a very kind heart and is sometimes the subject of jokes or bullies because he never fights back, against ordinary humans, or often hollows and Soul Reapers until necessary. Nonetheless, he is treated equally within his group of friends in Karakura (Ichigo, Keigo and Mizuiro). As he and Ichigo have a longtime relationship, having met each other while fighting off a group of bullies. Since then both decided to fight together, Chad becomes determined to train and get stronger in order to aid Ichigo in his fights as Ichigo and his enemies start becoming much stronger than Chad along the series.[5] Chad also has a weakness for cute things, like small animals and Kon, and is one of the few characters that actually treats Kon with any dignity but for the most part ignores him. In a recent omake, when Orihime is trying to catch Nozomi with a plush cat, she captures Chad instead, who begins to cuddle with it.[7] Besides his physical strength being able to lift 400 kg with ease, Chad has also shown to be very intelligent; he ranked 11th out of 322 in school, while Ichigo is ranked 23rd.[8]
